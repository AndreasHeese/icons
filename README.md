# Icons
SVG icons (only a few made as needed)

<img src="./icon-barrel.svg" alt="barrel" width="60"/><img src="./icon-component-production.svg" alt="component production" width="80"/><img src="./icon-car-production.svg" alt="car production" width="80"/><img src="./icon-car-moving.svg" alt="car moving" width="80"/><img src="./icon-pump.svg" alt="pump" width="60"/><img src="./icon-battery.svg" alt="battery" width="60"/>

The icons are not created using a vector graphics design program like ai, but are written directly in code with an editor. Anyone can use them, but they hopefully will suit espacially if you are also writing SVG code. Curves are not a buch of points connected through straight lines but true curves. The coordinates zero point is in the middle, so it's easier to center then when transforming/translating.
